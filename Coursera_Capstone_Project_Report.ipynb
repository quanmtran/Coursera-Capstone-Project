        "Melbourne is one among the world's most liveable cities which has been attracting many international students from different countries around the globe. The city was ranked the third best student city in the world according to [QS Best Student Cities 2019](https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2019). However, before moving into a brand new city, international students will probably have a lot of questions need to be answered. As starters, when he/she has an idea of where their education provider is located, the first question that comes into their mind would be where to live. While it is better to find a place that is not far away from school, there are other factors that need to be taken into consideration like how close it is to venues in need, for example, supermarkets, grocery stores and recreational areas. Understanding these concerns, we have done this data-driven analysis project to explore the suburbs in Melbourne, targeting at international students who are about to come to the city. We hope that our findings would help those newcomers to have a better idea about different suburbs in Melbourne in order to make a decision on where they want to reside in."
